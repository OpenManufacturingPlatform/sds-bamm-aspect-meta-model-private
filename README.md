## Introduction
The Semantic Aspect Meta Model (SAMM) allows the creation of models to describe the semantics of
digital twins by defining their domain specific aspects. In this context, digital twins are the
digital representation of a physical or virtual object that bundles and combines several aspects.
SAMM provides a set of predefined objects (as depicted below) that allow a domain expert to define
aspect models and complement a digital twin with a semantic foundation.

SAMM was previously known as BAMM (BAMM Aspect Meta Model).

This repository contains the detailed documentation of the SAMM specification as an
[Antora](https://antora.org/) module, as well the formal specification parts as
[SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) shapes.

The source files (AsciiDoc) are built using Maven and
[Antora](https://antora.org/), which generates the documentation as HTML files.

## Example Usage
SAMM standardizes the creation of domain specific aspect models and also makes them reusable.
Therefore, the created aspects can be used in several different digital twins.

Imagine an automated guided vehicle (AGV) and its digital representation.
The AGV digital twin could encompass aspects, such as its movement position or battery state.
However, both aspects could also be part of other digital twins.
This modularization and reusability simplifies the creation of highly complex use cases.

## Build and contribute

### Build the documentation
To build the Antora documentation locally, clone the repository and run

```sh
./mvnw generate-resources -pl documentation -Pantora
```

inside the repository folder.

Navigate to *build* > *site* and open the `index.html` page in your web browser to see the result.
Repeat the steps everytime you make any changes in the documentation and want to inspect the final outcome.

### Build the SAMM artifact
To build the Semantic Aspect Meta Model Java artifact, run

```sh
./mvnw clean install -pl esmf-samm-build-plugin
./mvnw clean package -pl esmf-semantic-aspect-meta-model
```

This will compile the code and run all tests. The resulting JAR file can be found under
esmf-semantic-aspect-meta-model > target. Please be aware, that you need JDK 11 to run build and
tests.
